# PULSE-WIDTH-FREQUENCY-CONTROL-UNIT-WITH-PWM-SIGNAL-GENERATION-WITH-PROGRAMMABLE-FREQUENCY-SCALING
This project presents the design and implementation of a Pulse Width Frequency Control Unit that generates a Pulse Width Modulated (PWM) signal with programmable frequency scaling. The system allows precise control over both duty cycle and output frequency, enabling flexible signal modulation for embedded and power electronics applications.
Features:
PWM Signal Generation with configurable duty cycle.
Programmable Frequency Scaling for flexible output tuning.
Support for multiple frequency ranges and resolution levels.
Suitable for microcontrollers, FPGA, or ASIC-based implementations.
Modular and reusable codebase for integration in embedded projects.
Possible Use Cases:
Motor speed control
LED dimming
Audio signal generation
Power regulation systems
Communication protocols using PWM
